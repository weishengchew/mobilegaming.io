<h2>What game modes are there in this game?</h2>
<p>There are so, so many game modes to choose from, each with a unique objective to be achieved! Here's a brief overview of the game modes available, as well as my personal rating on how fun each game mode is~ It's just my personal opinion, so no hate please!</p>

<h2>Why do I enjoy this game?</h2>
<h3>1. It is <b>highly strategic</b>.</h3>
<p>There is no single right way to play any of the game modes, and it is up to you and your team to decide how you want to achieve the winning objective. From picking the best brawlers for each game mode and map to deciding which players take which lanes to control the opponents, no two games are the same and players need to constantly strategise and work together to win. </p>
<h3>2. It promotes a high level of <b>teamwork and communication</b>.</h3>
<p>There have been countless time when my teammates and I completely dominated our opponents, simply because their teamwork was not as cohesive as ours. As a real-time, fast-paced battle royale, there is absolutely no room for making bad plays in Brawl Stars. Good teamwork will always triumph in the end - there is nothing worse than having a freeloader on the team!</p>
<h3>3. It is <b>completely free-to-play</b>.</h3>
<p>Unlike many other "free-to-play" games under the same genre, Brawl Stars is <i>actually</i> free-to-play - and by this, I mean that microtransactions in the game are entirely unnecessary for you to progress in the game. I love how this game can be enjoyed for what it is and that I can be a 'pro' as well, without having to spend hundreds of dollars to gain an advantage over other players.</p>
<p>Seriously, what's not to love about this game? Try it to believe it!
