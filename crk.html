<h2>What else should I know before getting into the game?</h2>

<p>... Alright, I'll reveal the truth. Cookie Run Kingdom is a Gacha game, which means that it implements the gacha (toy vending machine) mechanic. Similar to loot boxes (prize crate) in other video games, gacha games induce players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. While Cookie Run Kingdom is a free-to-play game, the gacha serves as an incentive to spend real-world money.</p>
<p>What this means is that if you intend to collect the entire roster of adorable Cookies, be prepare to spend <i>ALOT</i> of money...</p>
<p>But that's not gonna stop you from still playing this game... Right?</p>
